# decison-tree-report-2020
Decision tree and naive bayes explanation using examples.

This repository consists of the project report and the slides made as a part of final year B. Tech. project.

I'm sharing this here for my own record and for everyone who needs to understand how a decision tree works. This report was compiled along with github user Apoorva-Chouhan (https://github.com/Apoorva-Chouhan/) who explained the naive bayes algorithm.
